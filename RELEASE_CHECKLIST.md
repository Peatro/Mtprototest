# RELEASE CHECKLIST

## Fresh Start

- [ ] `./gradlew test` passes
- [ ] application starts locally with the intended profile
- [ ] Liquibase migrations apply cleanly on an empty database
- [ ] `/actuator/health` returns `UP`
  Use the normal launch profile or allow at least one successful import/check cycle to complete first; with startup bootstrap disabled, custom operational health may stay `DOWN`

- [ ] `/docs` and `/v3/api-docs` are reachable

## Configuration

- [ ] PostgreSQL connection values are set for the target environment
- [ ] `app.admin.enabled=true` outside local development
- [ ] `app.admin.key` is set and not empty
- [ ] enabled proxy sources are reviewed and reachable
- [ ] startup batch and deep probe limits are reviewed for the current catalog size
- [ ] checker batch size and executor concurrency are reviewed for the current catalog size
- [ ] public rate limits are reviewed
- [ ] feedback abuse thresholds are reviewed

## Operational Safety

- [ ] admin endpoints are not exposed without protection

- [ ] reverse proxy preserves real client IP headers consistently
- [ ] monitoring is configured against `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/prometheus`
- [ ] logs are collected from the application process
- [ ] database backup approach is defined
- [x] backup owner is assigned
  Owner: `Peatr`

  Owner: `Peatr`

## Product Readiness

- [ ] public website loads on desktop
